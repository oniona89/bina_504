#OM/USDT Take-Profit target 3 ‚úÖ
Profit: 64.7515% üìà
Period: 6 Hours 17 Minutes ‚è∞
2024-11-26T11:33:34.450Z - Received non-JSON response: The signal message does not provide all the information needed to fill every field in the required JSON format. The information about position, entry price range, leverage, and stop-loss is missing. We do have a trading pair and a profit target.

One reasonable assumption we can make is that the position was "LONG", since a profit was made (most traders make profit from long positions, especially in bullish conditions). But we need to note that this is an assumption, the real position could have been "SHORT" as well. 

For the other missing elements, without further information, we cannot make accurate guesses. Therefore, the resulted JSON will contain null values for such elements. 

Additionally, we cannot accurately determine the "targets" value from the message, because it states "Take-Profit target 3" but doesn't give an actual value. We are to take the assumption that the profit of 64.7515% could be the third take-profit target but this could be inaccurate, it should have been explicitly mentioned in the signal message.

Here's the resultant JSON:

{
  "position": "LONG", 
  "symbol": "OM/USDT", 
  "entryPriceRange": null, 
  "targets": [64.7515], 
  "leverage": null,
